Hey, I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Very rarely do you catch me out
Y'all done "specially invited guest"'d me out
Y'all been tellin' jokes that's gon' stress me out
Soon as I walk in, I'm like, "Let's be out"
I was off the chain, I was often drained
I was off the meds, I was called insane
What a awesome thing, engulfed in shame
I want all the rain, I want all the pain
I want all the smoke, I want all the blame
Cardio audio, let me jog your brain
Caught in the Audy Home, we was all detained
All of you Mario, it's all a game
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I had my issues, ain't that much I could do
Peace is somethin' that starts with me (with me)
At times, wonder my purpose
Easy than to feel worthless
But, peace is somethin' that starts with me (with me, with me)
Had so much on my mind, I didn't know where to go
I've come a long way from them hauntin' me
Had me feelin' oh so low
Ain't no stoppin' you, no way
Oh, things ain't like before
Ain't no stoppin' you, no way
No stress yes, I'm so blessed and-
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward

(Movin' forward, movin' forward, movin' forward)
Movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Something was wrong (Keep movin' forward)
Couldn't hold on, why? (Keep movin' forward)
So long (Keep movin' forward)
Sit here in this storm (Keep movin' forward)
Time goes on (Keep movin' forward)
Really couldn't find my way out (Keep movin' forward)
Of the storm (Keep movin' forward)
Which way do I go?
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Stop that movement, stop that movement
Y'all can't move me, this my movie
Y'all can't stop me, y'all too sloppy
Carbon copied, carbon
Same thing, in a room
Sittin' by myself, findin' heaven soon
Many things that will trouble you
Look beyond for a feelin' like you never knew
Reachin' out, huntin' for the truth
I'm guessin' I'm just sick of runnin'
All this time searchin' hard for somethin'
I can hear the angels comin'

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Well, it took me long enough to rap on this strong enough
Paid this shit just gon' give up, 'cause Ye just gon' live up
To everything that sucks to you and that's never enough
Thought I'd be clever enough to give up while I'm ahead
I like breakfast in bed, but I love breakfast and head
For anybody who said that I was better off dead
Told 'em, "Don't ever believe nothin' that you ever read"
Got a Bible by my bed, oh yes, I'm very Christian
Constantly repentin', 'cause, yes, I never listen
Don't like bein' questioned and don't like bein' less than
Any a competition in any of my professions
So I gotta guess then, I gotta stay the best man
What else you expect from, uh, Mr. West, man
Painting from Wes Lang, hung in my space like a relative
That you ain't seen in a minute, called on the telephone
And when they see you they say, “Damn you got hella grown
Always thought you'd make it, but damn now you hella known"
Let's address some topics that I can embellish on
How we made enough bread for us to put some relish on
I won't relish on the fact I'm vibin' on the future
Ultralight buildin' in the buildin' by Miuccia
Herzog and de Meuron in an office out in Basel
No not Miami, Switzerland (Switzerland, ahahaha)
