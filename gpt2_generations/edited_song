It's been a while since I posted something. 
I guess it's finally come around for me to hit the post. 
Cause I was so far from home. 
I used to love back when hoes would play host. 
Ye, old mate beef, playa hate. 
But since goin' to Jacob's, I guess it's back to square one. 
I guess being a black Christian warrior. 
Ain't much use when your cousins get niggas. 
Swear they seen us punchin' up the plantation. 
Well, maybe they have, if they ever saw us punchin' up the plantation. 
But we ain't there yet. 
And you think you're so tough now, you got Club W's. 

Can we get much higher? So high. 
So high. So high. So high. So high. So high. 
Climbing, climbing, climbing. 
Building, building, building. 
It's a culture, it's a whole different ballgame. 

Hey brother, I got a new addition. 
You don't even know what I'm sayin'. 
I'm talkin' 'bout two years from now. 
But first of all, I'm a little late. 
Cause I had to get this bachelor to. 
But I love you so much now, I couldn't care less. 

So I don't really give a fuck what people say. 
I know you did it, I know you did it. 
I just wanna be a man, live a good life. 
And be a real man, be a real man. 
And be a real man, be a real man. 
And be a real man, be a real man. 

One hand in the air if you don't really care. 
Two hands in the air if you don't really care. 
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous. 
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous. 

One hand in the air if you don't really care. 
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care. 
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous. 
Life can be sometimes ridiculous. 
I'm so outrageous sometimes. 
I'm so outrageous sometimes. 
I'm so outrageous sometimes. 
I'm so—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah
I'm so—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah

Good morning! 
Good morning! 
Good morning! 
Good morning!
I'm back. 
I'm back. 
I'm back. 
I'm back. 
Yeah, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi.
