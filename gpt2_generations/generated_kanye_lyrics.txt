A young, thin, Asian woman with all the money in the world. Polishing off that Louis Vuitton. Stepping off that Louis Vuitton. Step off that Louis Vuitton. She eyeing me up like, "Are you a virgin?". I'm like, "Naw, I was just lazing around. Do you mind if I borrow your tape player for the after-parties". She's got the whole intro memorized, like three hours' worth. I mean, seriously, what's on that girl's mind?. Just go ahead and bring up the old ground rules, I promise you, they're well-known. Just let it be known, ladies and gentlemen, I bring the fire. All the way to the store's exit, I jump through the security gate. Once I get past the security, I start walking. I see these big-ass tits move. That big-ass tits move. That big-ass tits move.

I know it's been a while, but I just wanted to say thanks to everyone that's been supporting me this far. I've been holding it together, I keep trying to find my voice. But thanks to all of the angels on this earth. There's just one that I can thank. Without my family I wouldn't have no voice. Without my family I wouldn't have to stop. For all the fans wonderin' where my Daisy. I'm goin' on a scavenger hunt. I've been laborinator, I've been meditator. I've been charitable, I've been malicious. I've been a savior, and I'm just gonna keep on being. That's why I'mma have to take my business elsewhere. Home of the truly devoted. I know that I'm the change I want. That I know that I want. That I know that I want. That I know that I want. That I know that I want. That I know that I want. That I know that I want. That I know that I want. That I know that I want. That I know that I want.

As I sat in the clubber trying to find my soul mate, I couldn't help but notice how many girls were staring back at me. They had their hands in the air, looking like fools. I looked at the ceiling, and mouthed, "Fuck it". As I turned the pages of my manuscript, it seemed like there was no end to the troubles. Things I could not remedy, or alter, or. No matter how much effort I put into my craft. I could never make it to a good club. No, my soul mate, my only true mate. I turned the pages of my manuscript, and I saw it. It was written in blood and in tears and in anxiety. I saw it with hate in my eyes, and I knew. It was written in blood and in tears and in anxiety. I turned the pages of my manuscript, and I saw it.

In the late 90's there was an electronic duo called Momentum. I loved them. I was their biggest fan. So I bought them a rug. And I made them buy more. I was so proud of them. In the video game "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare". I played like ninety-one minutes. I killed the game, I killed the franchise. And I loved myself so fucking much, I called it off. I took the mask off, I unzipped my fucking robe. And in my glorious naked self I said. "Fuck everything I've ever been guilty of". Black, white, gay, straight, transsexual. I've been caught in all the sins of humanity. And I stand before you looking like the calumny I'm judged by. People saying "He lost his mind angel". The day my life was on the screener". The day I became a father. Those are the feelings that I have. For any man that would cheat the system. I'm sorry, but I can't give them inples away. I know it's gay night, but I've been too lazy.

About

Thank you to all of my fans. I wish I could show you all of my lights. I've been feeling all of my demons. Turning my back on God and my brothers. My head is still spinning from the night I spent in the brig. With no money, no things to give. I walked out on my wife and kids. And drove three hours to Philadelphia. To seek my God. When I arrived, I found the door locked. I sat down at the table and waited. Nothing was said. Then, out the blue, I heard the doorbell. And, "Will you marry me?" And, "Where you get your titties from?"And, "How long has she been gay?"And, "How long has she been sober?"And, "You've been courting her for years." And, "You can't keep her from me anymore." These are the words that I've been waiting for all these years. These are the things I've been wishing for. All these years. I've been waiting for a true lover. Until they say goodbye. And, I'll never let you go. And, I'll never let you go. And, I'll never let you go. And, I never let you go. And, never let you go

As you camped out to my every word, I was content. But after that, man I'm all for it. I know some things are meant to stay that way. That's just the crop, that's the way I grew up. IRL, I'm just a real life version of myself. Tinder profile, Tinder bio. "I don't really fit in with guys these days". Damn, anyway, they like me for who I am. Not what other people see on TV. Not what other people do in the bathroom. Not what other people wear at the mall. Not even what my mate's name is. That's just the name of the song I made. I made that song to sooth a deep rooted anxiety. That if I ever to talk to a girl at all. She'll start talking about the bills or the kids or the band. And how they make too much noise and how they don't really have that much going for them. Look, I ain't talkin' 'bout Mikel, I'm just dissin' how he. Man, I made it out of these niggas that was. I'm like, "Damn, I'm out of here!". And then I heard That Jew Neff do that. Song where he play that song and he just sing along. That's what I did, I took that step. I took that step and I'm out. And if he ever down in the streets at all. I'm lookin' for him, I'm lookin' for him. And I know he find me, so what else do I know. I know he gon' find me, so what else do I know.

On the night I made love to your front door. You said you couldn't make me. But I still made love to your front door. The smell of marijuana wafting in. A girl I barely knew. Carried weed with no papers. Was on some J's but couldn't find the right one. Now I see why they got me. Gang signs, Italian look, carry-n-ship. But when I speak the tongue it get tuckered. You love to fuck around then?. Niggas talking shit but then you fuck around some more. And when I pull out. You pull out and shoot your lights out. That's some good money. We started out cheap but as we went up we went up higher. Versace wrapped around my waist. Spring rolls in the mail, how you know?. What's that you got in a freezer?. Candy jars in the mail. I'm preggin' so hard so I might as well suck it. Ohhh I want that right now. I'm comin' home again. Shit she say she done broke. But she done broke anyway so. What's that you say to that?. You say you gonna LA?. But I'm comin' home again. Shit she say she done broke. But she done broke anyway so. What's that you say to that?. You say you'll take it slow. But took it too far too far. And it happened again. Damn, did I mess up my statement. I got a lot of things

But we still loaded up ourys and drove home. But we don't wanna leave 'til we get a room like this. They say "booking hard, you should contact an attorney. Get a room like this". I said "nah, nah, nah, nah, you gon' find someone better." And I practiced my black balla ways. My black ways, my black ways, nigga. I ain't play you, jump back now. Don't be shy, dig in, do your thing. I am who I am and who I love. And I won't forgive you for the pain you're in. I can't let you ever do that which I can't. Not when we got that love story. Not when we still have that song. Not when we still got that song. I'm still here, baby, I'm still here. Got a brand new sound, got a whole new crew. I know they say I'm crazy, but they really are the most. Crazy as they come, but I'm the same. I'm that bitch that you shouldn't fuck with. And you better believe that nigga that got you fucked. I know you tried to get with somebody else. I don't know, I just wasn't choosy. Plantain, eat one, jog one. Grape, eat one, jog one. Grape, eat one,

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We end today's show with an exclusive story. It's a shocking story. A woman who was a victim of domestic violence. Flew to a local hospital, but doctors said her face was so badly burned up from the abuse that she couldn't survive the surgery. So she spent two days in the emergency room. After two days in the hospital, the doctor who treated her said she was too weak to make it. So the next day she went home, but just to see if her husband would come home. That's right, she called him. That's right, the next morning she called him up. And that's how we met. Jen�s story. It�s kind of crazy that I�m still alive. I just want my husband back.

And this is part one of my look at the Bulls. I think this is going to be a pretty crazy year. I'm loving every second. See, last year I told you all what I was going to do. I'm finally going to let the chips fall where they may. I'm finally going to roll up, grab a bite, and for God's sake don't freak out. We'll be right back, take care.

A few years ago, I was sitting in my dad's office, idly brainstorming ways to make my dad mad. One of my ideas was to record an angry hardcore rap song. The next thing I know, I'm in the studio shredding. The next thing I know, I'm on the road playing to big rooms. Touring the country fair circuit. I'm in the audience when Jeff Beck recorded "Thy Kingdom Come". The kingdom come, my kingdom come. The morning I'ma get up, I'mma get on the computer and check Twitter. I'm in the audience when ZZ's "I Got a Dream Business Plan". The first nigga I saw roll up, I felt like him and Kanye should play some tracks. I started following him, he had these little music blogs. One day I'm trying to get my own blog, and he had this idea of doing a compilation. I was like, "Oh, that'll never happen, that'll never happen. You gotta be out of your mind to do that. You gotta be able to visualize the equipment." I'm sure he tried to pull the same shit. I'm sure he tried to pull the same shit. I'm sure he tried to pull the same shit. The second he got the mic, he started spitting shit like it wasn'tbad news. It was like the poor sucker got robbed. Wasn't he born in the wrong year?. Somebody had to pay for him, right?. Been dying to do this his whole life. I knew that day that I was doomed. That's right, I made that ass' day. I made that ass' day, I made that ass' day. Make that ass celebrate, make that ass do it. That's right, I'm done. Is it summer or not?. Tell my girlfriend I'm back in town. She said she've never seen me not be proud. She said she never seen me

I want to talk to you about your love. For your love. For your love. For your love. Tell me. I'm sensing mood swings. More intense than any phone call. More intense than a crowded club. More intense than being ignored. It's Ethan Hawke weekend. I'm sitting in the club with my face in my iPod. I'm trying to find something that won't break the ice. I'm dissing my shoes so much, they might break the fall. I'm dissing my nails so much, they might break the spring. I'm dissing my suit so much, it might break the grid. I'm dissing myself, I might break the jail. So tell me again, what's so important?. What's so important that I won't take your recommendation?. Or maybe you could at least let me try?. Tell me again, what's so important?. What's so important that I won't take your recommendation?. Or maybe you could at least let me try?. Tell me again, what's so important?.

I'm telling me, what's so important?. Life is important. Let the games begin. Let the games begin. On some warped logic, I'd rather be in the club. But since we got caught smoking weed. I know we look like an odd couple. But can we please get a job?. Right now, we'd be better off at home. Strippers get paid, right?. But I ain't got the cash, right?. So we play the victim. She said "I don't want no philanderer". But I ain't got the blues, right?. And I know you ain't got the answers. So let's play

Lima, June 26th 1984. Five o'clock in the morning. I'm coming out of the bathroom, when all of a sudden I see a light in the mirror. I come home, look in the mirror, I see your beauty. You don't have nothing on me, I'm mesmerized. And begin to dance. The first verse is very direct. The second verse I think better of myself. And say the words that better of me. And when I get on that plane. I want to celebrate with my loved ones. But I'm afraid of offending anyone. Especially my wife and daughter. I got the wrong crowd, they see my tattoos. They see my music, they hear my MRs. But I just want to party like everybody else. And I ain't sayin' I'm perfect. I made a mistake I'm gonna do better. Soon as I stepped on the stage, I began to perform. This a blessing, it's a curse. This a blessing, it's a curse. This a blessing, it's a curse. I guess it's a blessing, that I got dirt on myself.

Theresa May will never be trusted with our kids, says Donald Trump.

That's right, Donald Trump. Yours truly. Your children will be living in fear of you, and your circle of advisers. You'll have no one to blame but yourself. They say death by cop. Shooting suspects, the whole damn thing. Story of the century. Tragic, tragic story of the century. Now, listen to this gangsta rap. Talk about sour grapes. The whole damn thing, it's just another takedown. Two words, Maybach keys. Your whole life work, learned pros do what they do. Hey, you know how much I hate you. Now, don't get mad, learned pros. And I know you want it both ways, I can't tell you how many tears. They say Prince was much smarter than I was. But I still took the high road, signed with Roc-A-Fella. Ran Roc-A-Fella, ran to my own resources. Now I sit here with blood on my hands, anda sad face. Talking sense to your members, pleading with you. "We don't want you anymore. You don't teach your kids anymore. You don't care anymore. You don't care anymore". Listen, listen, listen, listen. You know how much I love you, don't ever ever let your kids go.

After a lot of back and forth, I went ahead and did it. I went ahead and called her. I called her up, I asked her. What would you do for me. And she said. I would never leave her. And I really tried my best not to leave her. But I just could not deny the truth. That I found when I was in the closet the whole time. For all the times I pretended like I wasn't a boy. That I wasn't a freak. That I wasn't supposed. That I wasn't supposed to like. That I wasn't supposed to. Well, I tried to pretend like I wasn't either. And I just could not deny the truth.

That I wasn't supposed to. After all of that, I couldn't help but think. Oh, how lonely we all were. My momma say she can't stand me anymore. And I know, I just wanna scream at her. But I can't let her see me like this. And I know, she can't help me either. So, I guess, like, maybe, just maybe. We could try something new this time.

I was just thinking, well I ain't got no major label, I ain't got no big company. I just wanna get my music out . . . and maybe get a little bit of press.

A Houston judge has ruled that a no-nonsense police officer can't be sued for excessive force.
The ruling came in the case of an off-duty Houston police officer who sued for excessive use of force. The officer claims that in the line of duty he was shot at by a black male. The officer who arrested the black male claimed that he was trying to get his Hands on Me card. The case went to trial but was thrown out when the attorney for the black male claimed that the officer didn't give a fuck about the facts. At the end of the day the attorney for the black male got off with just a slap on the wrist. It seems like every case that goes to trial in this town has a different outcome.

My name is Ta-Nehisi Coates. And I just wrote a really great essay for The Atlantic. Long story short, I was brutally beaten up by four plainclothes police officers. And they said my writing was poor. I don't even know where to begin with that. I got to get better at being poor. So, you know, after that brutal beating, they put me in the back of the police car. And they take my fingerprints and they check my writing. And here's the thing, here's the thing. They don't want black guys writing about black guys. Like, they don't want a black writer about a black guy. They want a black guy writing about a white guy. Or a black guy writing about a black girl. Or a black girl about a black girl. You know what I'm sayin'? I'ma turn this into a movie. We make her cry, we make her cry, we make her cry. Make her cry, we make her cry, we make her cry. I'm comin' home again. You know what I'm sayin'? I'ma turn this into a movie. We make her cry, we make her cry, we make her cry. Make her cry, we make her cry, we make her cry. I'm comin' home again
A lot of people hate me. I have to tell them. I'm just fine. Tell them, "Hide your hands. We got people that want to take your picture." . "Eye's in the sky, what's your income?" . "What's the race of your son?" . "How long has your husband been away?". Everybody run for the hills. I'm still top ten in the whole country. They say I'm doin' fine. But you know what? I'm not doing fine. I'm just fine. Tell them. I'm just fine. I'm just fine. Tell them.

It took me years to find my voice. Longer still to find my rhythm. So I picked and picked at my belt. I picked and picked at my mink coat. I picked and picked at my sword. And I picked and picked at the crown. I finally found my spot. And I'm glad I found it in my gut. I'd rather be a thief than a murderer. I'd rather be a thief than a murderer. I guess it all depends how you look at it. It's like they said, it's like he said. I guess being a realist is just my style. I guess it's like, he said. I guess it's like, he said. He said, "X, Y, and Z". I said, "X, Y, and Z" again. And picked up where we left off. In this raw deal like you never knew where you came from. Ramrod-dick like you never knew where you came from. I thought I'd be a doctor, I guess I was crazy. But I been a real killer, runnin' interference, botching plans. Always stuck with the same plan, killin' as many people as I could. One day I'd done it, I couldn't stop. And I'm lookin' for a way out, so I pulled the trigger. And I died young, and I died a virgin. And I'm lookin' for a way out, so I did the deed. Now I'm lookin' for a way home, so I crawled out the other side. What it do? It do. I've been tryin' to make you love me. But all the while, they tryna hate us. They tryna make us all the enemies I'm known for. I guess that's why I've become known for something. I guess that's why I've become known for. Damn, here we go again. Damn, here

On October 10, 1948, the St. Louis Cardinals hosted the Cleveland Indians at Progressive Field. It was the final game before the new park, Progressive, opened up. Joe Morgan led off the game with a single to right field. The seats went cold, and the moon was shining. Joe Morgan, you are my everything. And I don't feel like nobody. So I took a swing at 'Ye, and I tried to take 'Ye, and I failed. But I'll always have you by my side. So keep on breathing, keep on breathing, keep on breathing in. Keep on breathing in. Keep on breathing in. It's like that sometimes, I'm a miracle. The best wishes are always in my Bible. But lately, they've been written in Kleenex. Whenever I read, keep it clean, please. Whenever I pray, ask for strength. For all your dreams that I have. They're coming true, they're coming true. Soon as you get here, it's over. You'll always have my number, my access code. So call, text, or hit up my office. I'm always there, take your camera out. And I'm always around, to give you the cold shoulder. So don't be considerate, or you might find love. Many miracles, they don't expect the strangest. There's nobody better than me, to share my magic. None of you vermin, you'll all be left with your hair in a bun. You'll all be left with your braids in a bun. You'll all be left with your vomit in a glass. I'm all that's left, with my last drop. Breath in, breathe out, baby let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go, no to hate. 'Til death, let's go, let's go, no to hate. 'Til death, let's go, let's go,

A mommy conspiracy theory. A mommy conspiracy theory. How'd you get on that first flight?. Well, you know, I had to meet all of my Dreamgirls. Just to prove to God I'm his daughter. And I met Jackie at 7th and May. With my mom's permission, I flew with my dad. And my mommy conspiracy. It's true, it's true. That day, I blur the line. Between my kids and me. And I did it without checking the papers. Without asking any men's rights. People look at me like I'm crazy. But I promise you, I'm much more creative with my mama. All the girls in the class were my friends. Girls I used to fuck. But I got the perfect wife, now you see my point. So I quit my job, I ride my bike, write my own music. I'm just a real-life Malcolm X. And I'm trying to be a role model. Like my little mama. So I handed her all the magazines. And I told her, "This is what you want, mama". "This is what you want, mama". So she got all of the magazines. And put them in the trunk. The car that you never got to see. The one where the music was supposed to start. I guess she was too wired. I feel the pressure now, don't I. Don't have to answer no to get some good. Advice. All the girls in the class were my friends. Girls I used to fuck. But I got the perfect wife, now you see my point. So I quit my job, I ride my bike, write my own music. I'm just a real-life Malcolm X. And I'm trying to be a role model. Like my little mama. So I handed her all of the magazines.

My friend showed me pictures of his kids. And all I could show him was pictures of my kids. And pictures of my kids. And pictures of my kids. And pictures of my kids. And pictures of my kids. And my favorite one was of my daughters. Standing by themselves on the street. With no idea what the fuck they talking about. Blow your whistle, now and forever. My daughters, they'll never know. If a nigga don't know what he doing. They just sort of stand there. And listen to some hip-hop and do their thing. My favorite one was of my daughters. Standing by themselves on the street. With no idea what the fuck they talking about. Blow your whistle, now and forever. Now, now, now, now. And I remember that first one, my daughter. She was like, "Ba-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da". Her face just lit up when she told me. "I made her turn out the jig". "She don't like me, so she'll only like one person". "Joke's on you, I had her shave her legs a week before the baby shower". "She don't like me, so I had to get her favourite rapper to do her hair for her for no money". "No lies, please, just one more thing to get her in the zone". "Uhh, but she like jay-z, please, no tricks". "Try my new move,
