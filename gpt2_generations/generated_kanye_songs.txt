For my theme song . My song "Rockstar" . I made it to the top. I'm supposed to be reaching for the stars. But I can't seem to pull the top off. What do you do when you know you're supposed to be going?. Going off the money I taken some of the big ones. One of 'em got a gold watch like they got gold time. I rolled up with the girls that said �terry, do you wanna go out or not. And I�m goin back to school to be a real man. And I tryna get along. And I�m goin back to school to be a good husband. And I�m goin back to school to be a good father. And I�m goin back to school to be a good man. And I�m goin back to school to be a good mother. And I got to keep going. Keep goin' 'til you get there. And I got a date with somebody. That's my little secret. And I don�t tell nobody. Baby, don't worry about it, it's nothing serious. It's nothing serious. Baby, don't worry about it, it's nothing serious. Baby, don't worry about it, it's nothing serious.

The new book is called 5 Star Move . It's a workout plan that will get your ass moving. Work your glutes, work your abs, and get that bench press under 700. Then you go and take that bitch to the cleaners, you know. That's my bitch, that's how I'll treat you. After that, we die. After that, we die. After that's all of our problems, problems become issues. And I'm not gonna deal with problems if they get out of hand. So I won't be taking any summer time off. I won't be taking daycare. I won't be taking medications. I won't be raising my kids the way I want them to. I won't be taking them to the doctor if they have eczema. I don't care what people say. I don't care what people say. I'll play any artist I want, they have to love the heat. Sun it's still the sun, we still rock. I'mma have to hit them with the gospel, "Get on down". Hpnotiq it's 'Til it's "Root", root". Yo, root for the kid that got the most problems. That ain't right, that's anathema. And yet, I'll still fly in the face of convention. I guess it's fitting then that I've become a colossal idiot. Nowadays, I guess it's fitting then that I've become a colossal idiot. Nowadays, I guess it's fitting then that I've become a colossal idiot. I made Jesus Christ of the fucking phone book. And I own this franchise. I know there's people that don't really get it. But I own this floor and I own this city. And I'mma get the hell out if you don't quite get it. You see I'mma get the hell out if you don't quite get it. You see I'mma get the hell out if you don't quite get it. If you don't quite get it, then I'mma have to disagree. I'mma have to disagree. I'mma have to disagree. I'mma have to disagree. I'mma have to disagree. I'mma have to disagree. I'mma have to disagree. I'mma have to disagree. Yeah, breathe in, breathe out. If you feel the least, then you're missing the whole point. If you feel the least, then you're missing the whole point. The-oh-my-god. Hpnotiq it's 'Til it's "Root", root". Yo, root for the kid that got the most problems. That ain't right, that's anathema. And yet, I'll still fly in the face of convention. I guess it's fitting then that I've become a colossal idiot. Nowadays, I guess it's fitting then that I've become a colossal idiot. Nowadays, I guess it's fitting then that I've become a colossal idiot. I breathe new music, I'm always adding more. And you ask yourself questions, I answer them. How do I say it better? Like, how do I say "I'mma leave in a couple of weeks"?. I dunno, I just always come up with something new. And I don't know if anybody knows what that is. But I know that everybody who's ever been to the mall. Said they'd be back next spring. And everybody that ever been to the movies. Said they wanted to go to the dome. But nobody's been able to get a team. Well, I was able to get a call from the team that bought my billboard. They said, "We got a deal for you. Just call me. Kevin. You know, like Grant or Tracy. And just say. 'I'mma get you a car, or a truck, or some jeans'. And I'll be there in a couple of days.". So I went up to their room and I just took out my social security. I just wrote them, 'bout an accident. Been trying to get together for years. And I haven't remembered my number forever. And I went back to the dealership and I tried to negotiate. But the mechanic said, "Look, you've got to remember that when you were growing up. The main thing that people was interested in was. How you could get your foot in the door of a brand". And the more I talked the more frustrated I got. So the manager came in and he's a realist. He tell me what he think. He say, "You know, you've got to remember that when you were growing up. The main thing that people was interested in was. How you could get your foot in the door of a brand". And the more I talked the more frustrated I got. And I had this whole album in

A soccer mom from Columbus, Ohio is now a motivational speaker and mommy blogger. See, a year ago, my husband and I were deciding whether or not we were gonna try again. The day we decided. I took him out to a restaurant, and I told him off the bat, "You know, I might try again one day". And he's like, "Oh, I've been thinking a lot more about it". And the day I decided. I took him out to a restaurant, and I told him off the bet, and said, "Look, you know I love you so, so much, but I just don't think I'll ever be able to go back out there and play. And the second I think about going out there and playing, I wanna die. And I wanna die on that field with my hands up and my arms wide. And say, 'Fuck that, I'm gonna kill myself.' And you know, the more I thought about it, the more I wanna live. The more I thought about it, the more I wanna die. And I just wanted to say, I really, really, really wanted to die on that field with my hands up and my arms wide. And say, 'Fuck that, I'm gonna kill myself.'

But if I was a murderer, I'd probably do the same to everybody. I hit the liquor store, looked up, and there she was, blood and beer all over her. Wanted to scream. But what she needed was a professional. And I was there, I helped myself. How could I not be there?. She said she loves me now. But I know now. She never loved me. So I never really loved her. All that time we had. And I never really loved anybody. All that time we had. And I never really loved anybody. All that time we had. And I never really loved anybody. All that time we had

A mum-of-three was left with just one question when she stopped by the post office.

Amber Edmonds, from Lincoln, told the employee she was from the video game magazine and asked if she could keep the mag.

The employee smiled and replied that she could send it to any other address in the world.

Amber Edmonds, a 40-year-old single mum-of-three, was browsing the mail one Monday last year when she came across something really odd.

She had gone to the post office to pick up her three daughters from day care, when all of a sudden she heard this really weird man talking to her from the other side of the desk.

The clerk asked what was going on and the man replied that he heard some girls talking and started laughing.

The clerk then asked what was going on and the man replied that he started laughing too.

A few days ago, I received an email from a very nice man. He told me, "Keep up the good work, man. I just wanted to let you know, I got a favor to ask." I started blabbering, "I got a favor to ask the devil". He started talking, and I kept getting defensive. I started talking, and talking, and talking. Finally, he said, "Let's just say it, I got a crush on Brittney West". I started blabbering, "I got a crush on Brittney West". I started blabbering, "I got a crush on Brittney West". And finally, after a really bad race, I got to the finish, and I saw the blood on his face and I'm like, "Damn, that was on video too". And I told my manager, and he called his guy, and he called my manager, and he called my manager, and he called my manager. And he said, "You got a crush on Brittney West?". I'm like, "Yeah, I got a crush on Brittney West". And I remember Brittney saying, "Yo, I'mma get your autograph". I'mtyl, I'mtyl, I'mma get your autograph!. And I remember him saying, "You got a crush on Brittney West?". I'mtyl, I'mtyl, I'mma get your autograph!. And I remember him saying, "You got a crush on Brittney West

Pushes me against the wall, starts kissing and fondling me. Rough, virgin pussy, I need to know. What is God's plan?. What is my destiny?. What is the meaning of my life?. What is the purpose of my life?. What is the meaning of my life?. What is the meaning of my life?. What is the meaning of my life?. What is the meaning of my life?. What is the meaning of my life?.

In the immortal words of Bruce Springsteen:. "Save me, save me, I'm so worried. I'm so worried about you, I'm pretendin'. You could've gone to any of your many. Any one of your many, could've gone off to war. I'm trying to get you out my heart, but it's like a tab. I'm so worried about you, I'm too scared. I'm so worried about you

Take a bow, Steve Jobs. You are rockin' my world. I can't believe it's already year's past. And we still don't know what the hell we gonna do for the night. . . . So we stay up all night figurein' shit out. See, that's how I was brought up in Chicago. My parents was the greatest. They had me fix bikes so I could go to school. My dad was a bike mechanic so I could afford a bike. My mom was a homemaker so I could afford a home. I ain't supposed to be sayin' this but I'm so proud of you. I keep these stories to myself but they really are. They say that you will be forever changed. But I never realized how much longer I'd be. This a story about staying true. Everything that we've been taught. Every setback, every hard day. Every moment we denied. From an early cradle to a crib. From a mother's breast to the breast of a child. I envision a galaxy far, far away. But there is one place I always return. I always return home. Home is where the heart is. So home is where the battles are. So I awake, I look around me. My brothers and sisters gathered before the stark. I look to the sky, I close my eyes. My brothers and sisters gathered before the stark. I look to the sky, I close my eyes. And I look around me. And I wonder if there is still hope. If there is still love in this world. That I can find. That I can find my way home. I'm walking through the sunset, I'm never gonna give up. Now what do I know? I'm so new in the game. Nobody ever knows you when you're just a name. So I'm on my own, guiding the new wave. Trakta nu, tai chi to the vault. Dak da, da da, da da. There is nowhere I escape from the rules. So I'm just gonna have to find my own. No matter what, you will never take that from me. My L, luxuriate in my control. Now where the soul is, my feet are the lava. Now where the soul is, my feet is the lava. I'm just gonna have to find my own. No matter what, you will never take that from me. My L, luxuriate in my control. Now where the soul is, my feet are the lava. Now where the soul is, my feet is the lava. I'm just gonna have to find my own. No matter what, you will never take that from me. L, luxuriate in my control. Now where the soul is, my feet are the lava. Now where the soul is, my feet is the lava. I'm just gonna have to find my own. No matter what, you will never take that from me. Y'all niggas can't escape my control. Y'all niggas can't escape my control. Y'all niggas can't escape my control. I'm just gonna have to find my own. No matter what, you will never take that from me

No matter what, you will never take that from me. My L, luxuriate in my control. Now where the soul is, my feet are the lava. Now where the soul is, my feet is the lava. I'm just gonna have to find my own. No matter what, you will never take that from me. My L, luxuriate in my control. Now where the soul is, my feet are the lava. Now

We've all been there. Looking at the trophies and saying "Yeah, I'm pretty much there". Told myself "Man, this is going to be so hard, I might as well pull through". Told everybody "It ain't our fault," Oh well. Looked at the trophies and said. "I should've just won one of these.". Told myself "Man, this is going to be so hard, I might as well pull through". Looked at the trophies and said. "It ain't our fault," Oh well. Looked at the trophies and said. "I should've just won one of these.". Told myself "Man, this is going to be so hard, I might as well pull through". Told myself "It ain't our fault."
It's amazing, I'm the reason. My voice, my style, my style. Why I can't find my passion. They don't understand I'm so. Special. I'm so so so so good, I'm goin' on 90 minutes. I'ma get my highness. I'ma get my highness. Yo, I'm so so so so good. I'm so so so so so good, I'm goin' on 90 minutes. I'ma get my highness. I'ma get my highness. I remember sitting there, I'm like. 'Bout an hour, I was like. I was high on ecstasy. And I think about killing you, I do. I think about killing you, I do. And I just kill myself. I just kill myself. Rest in peace, Pablo. Rest in peace, Pablo. Rest in peace, Pablo. Rest in peace, Pablo. Rest in peace, Pablo. Rest in peace, Pablo. Peace is finally a thing. You'll find it only in the club. The lights is low, the beats is snappy. And the Hovito running jokes. Ain't no offense, he do these in Harlem. Hit the subway, he the same guy. Drinking Scotch and smoking crack. Vision is my sole occupation. Textbook pro sports, ain't no problem. You can reach for a dictionary. Or a few Slaps and Cokes. But a lifetime of hard work. For those willing to work, no favors. I'm Larry "The House" McHugh. Speaker, I'm Larry "The House" McHugh. And I, I, I, I, I. You know the only way to find your truth. Is to break the rules, learn a new one.

One day, I realized. I realized I'm not the only one that feels that way. That's why I'm not me. I'm not me. I'm not me. I'm not me, no. Ok, no. One more time. I'm not complaining, that was a miss. Sorry about the mini-madrass. But, that was a miss. I had to remind myself. That I'm not some elitist. Boss like my papa, I ain't havin' him. Talked 'bout like an hour into lunch. And I'm like, "Man, this nigga so serious. But, he coulda gone in at any time. So, I went and found something more interesting to do. Which was to my left. And I looked in that other girl's eyes and I was like. "I'm into this." And I think that's all I needed. And I think that's all that happened. Is that that they're more open-minded. And that they might consider dating someone. Before they commit. Before they commit. No, no, no, no, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Sure as rain, that night sky will be filled with colors. Rainbow river, fall in love with a red dress. Rainbow sunrise, fall for a red carpet. Why, why, why? Why? Why? I'm finding it very hard. To come up with good answers. And so I keep on keeping on. And keep on keeping on anyways. And I, I keep on keeping on. And keep on
